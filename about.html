        <h1>Brief <span>History</span></h1>
        <p>Eucharistic Heart Of Jesus Model College, Asa-Dam Road, Ilorin, Kwara State was established in 1999 by the Sisters of the Eucharistic
            Heart of Jesus Congregation. It is a co-educational with a view to fostering and inculcating good and lasting moral values to young ones. <br>

            Among other things, the Sisters who founded this College have a sole aim of instilling genuine discipline and moral uprightness into 
            our educational system in particular and into the polity in general, with a view to turning out leaders who will sanitise our pluralistic 
            Nigeria society and the world at large. Effort is in top gear vigorously to achieve its desired success. <br>
            
            The foundation of the school was laid by the Catholic Bishop of Ilorin, His Lordship, Most Rev Dr. Ayo-Maria Atoyebi (OP) on 17th May 1999 
            and the take-off was on 27th september 1999 with eleven students. To the greater glory of God, the track performance record of the college 
            at WAEC and NECO has been 100% since inception.
