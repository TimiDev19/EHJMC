                    EHJMC offers Junior Secondary School education from entry level (JS1)
                    to exam level (JS3). The students will be taught a variety of subjects

                    discipline they choose.

                <p>
                    EHJMC has been know to produce one of the best external exam results not by
                    malpractice but by taking it upon themselves to hold extension classes to adequately 
                    prepare their students for the exams. The classes are from JS3 to SS3 and it is 
                    a method that has worked for years.
